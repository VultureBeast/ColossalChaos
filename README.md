# Colossal Chaos

Colossal Chaos is an arcade game I developed with a team during the first year of the game deign and programming course at Uppsala University. The game was developed in Unity and is meant to be played with a giant head we created during the development. The project spanned across aproximately 2 months.

## The Game
Your city is under attack by a rampaging giant! In anger and panic, you run towards the giant and manage getting up to his neck. Without any clear plan, you start pulling and pushing on the giants head and notice that he responds. It is now up to you to steer the giant out of town, and save as much as possible.

## The Input
So how do you play the game, how do you control the giant in real life? Well, exactly as you would in the game. Our team is currently working on creating a life-sized giant head with input that you will use to control the giant in the game.
